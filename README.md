# Compression Algorithms and Their Implementations

## Introduction

This is an implementation of the two well-known and widely deployed compression algorithms,
namely Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) and Huffman coding.

Lempel-Ziv-Welchm, or LZW in short for the sake of convenience naming,
is typically employing a fixed bit size for the result in its coding style,
though the coding algorithm never specifically
